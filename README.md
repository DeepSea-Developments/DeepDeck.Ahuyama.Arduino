# DeepDeck Ahuyama - Arduino

DeepDeck is an open source 5x5 mechanical keyboard, using ESP32 microcontroller.

This repository contains a demo code and libraries to be used with DeepDeck Ahuyama hardware
in Arduino Framework.

You can get the board and more information at this link https://deepdeck.co

For complex features we recommend to use Espressif IDF version https://github.com/DeepSea-Developments/DeepDeck.Ahuyama.fw

### Standard Libraries:
We use some libraries that you can find in arduino library manager or directly download using this links

- #include <BleKeyboard.h>https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard
- #include <Keypad.h> https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad
- #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
- #include <ESP32Encoder.h> https://github.com/madhephaestus/ESP32Encoder/
- #include <FastLED.h> https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

### Modified Libraries:

Install the  2 modified libraries that you can find inside of the repo folder as .zip files.

- DSD_Adafruit_APDS9960.zip
- DSD_Adafruit_SSD1306.zip

Both based on Adafruit libraries but modifed to resolve I2C sharings issues 
and thread safe.

We support all the same original features of the library.Here you can find the original Adafruit libraries and the version that we modifed.

- https://github.com/adafruit/DSD_Adafruit_APDS9960  version 1.2.3
- https://github.com/adafruit/DSD_Adafruit_SSD1306 version 2.5.7

### Arduino ESP32 core 

We use the core version 2.0.14 ,you can copy this link to Arduino preference
